# ASGM Front End Prototype

A.S.G.M. or Artisanal Small-Scale Gold Mining is a common practice in the Amazon rainforest that has been shown to contribute to alarming levels of deforestation and loss of biodiversity. The ASGM lab at Wake Forest University is an interdisciplinary lab combining researchers from the Computer Science and Biology departments. The ASGM-WFU lab utilizes machine learning algorithms that are deployed to automated drones to monitor areas of known and/or rapidly developing deforestation. The code that is presented in this repo is a prototype for a back end that will be later connected to a React JS front end in the future. This site will be used by the ASGM researchers in order to automate the ML workflow.
